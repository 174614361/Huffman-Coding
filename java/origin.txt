I Loved You,Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.I loved you; even now I may confess,Some embers of my love their fire retain;But do not let it cause you more distress,I do not want to sadden you again.Hopeless and tongue-tied, yet I loved you dearlyWith pangs the jealous and the timid know;So tenderly I loved you, so sincerely,I pray God grant another love you so.
